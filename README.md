# neo21.dev — Tools for Sovereign Individuals

Apps that don't track you. Platforms that don't own you.  
Bitcoin. Nostr. Privacy by default.

## What is this?

This is my corner of the internet. A personal launchpad for open-source tools built on freedom tech. I believe the web should serve people, not exploit them. Every project here is built with that conviction.

## What I build

- **Privacy-first apps** - No tracking, no data harvesting, no ads.
- **Bitcoin tools** - Because money should be free too.
- **Nostr utilities** - Communication without gatekeepers.

## The mission

I'm tired of apps that track you, platforms that own your data, and a web that treats people as products. So I build the alternative, tools that put you in control.

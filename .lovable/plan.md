# Improved Meta Title & Description

## Current State

| Element | Current Content |
|---------|-----------------|
| Title | `neo21.dev — Building for the Open Internet` |
| Description | `I build tools that respect your privacy. Bitcoin, Nostr & more. No tracking. No data collection. Privacy by default.` |

The current version is informative but lacks personality and punch. It reads like a checklist rather than a compelling hook.

## Proposed Options

### Option A: Bold & Rebellious (Recommended)

```text
Title: neo21.dev — Tools for Sovereign Individuals
Description: Apps that don't track you, platforms that don't own you. Bitcoin. Nostr. Privacy by default.
```

**Why it works:** "Sovereign individuals" speaks directly to the target audience. The description has rhythm and attitude.

## Technical Changes

Once you pick an option, I'll update these locations:

| File | Tags Updated |
|------|--------------|
| `index.html` | `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, `og:title`, `og:description`, `twitter:title`, `twitter:description` |

All 6 meta tags will be synchronized with your chosen copy.
